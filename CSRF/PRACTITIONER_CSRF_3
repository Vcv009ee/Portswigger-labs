Date:-9 January 2025
Level:-Practitioner

I am here to solve CSRF lab,as we have said in the description Token is not tied to user session
therefore we have to seek the parameter which change it values as the new session introducede.

We have provided the two credentials given below are:-

# Username:Password
  wiener:peter
  carlos:montoya

At first,i log in to the account using credential  wiener:peter and get a dasboard to update my email,i just enter some mail and change it.

Then i write the mail for update and capture the request on **Burp Suite Professional** and send the request to repeater.
